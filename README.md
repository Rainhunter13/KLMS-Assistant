# KLMS Assistant 

A telegram bot that notifies KAIST students when there is a new notice in KLMS (KAIST Learning Management System) account.

How many times did you forget about your homeworks or quizes, didn't note a changes in the classes schedule, or skip an important post from a course, and all of these just because you didn't check KLMS at time? Probably a lot.. But no more!
